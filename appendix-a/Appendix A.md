----------
Conclusion and Further Reading
==============================
The book is over but your learning is just starting. This appendix provides the book's conclusion, lists of JavaScript blog posts, articles, e-books, books, and other resources.

Conclusion
----------

We hope you've enjoyed this book. It was intended to be small on theory
but big on practice and give you an overview of multiple technologies,
frameworks, and techniques used in modern agile web development. Full
Stack JavaScript touched topics such as the following:

-   jQuery, JSON, and AJAX/XHR

-   Twitter Bootstrap, CSS, and LESS

-   Backbone.js, AMD, and Require.js

-   Node.js, REST API, and Parse.com

-   MongoDB and BSON

-   AWS, Heroku, and MongoLab

If you need in-depth knowledge or references, scroll down to the list of
suggested reading or do a Google search.

Practical aspects included building multiple versions of the Message
Board app:

-   jQuery + Parse.com JS REST API

-   Backbone and Parse.com JS SDK

-   Backbone and Node.js

-   Backbone and Node.js + MongoDB

The Message Board application has all the foundation of a typical
web/mobile application: fetching data, displaying it, submitting new
data. Other examples include:

-   jQuery + OpenWeatherMap RESP API

-   Parse.com "Save John"

-   Node.js "Hello World"

-   MongoDB "Print Collections"

-   Backbone.js "Hello World"

-   Backbone.js "Apple Database"

production web services with Express.js—a de facto standard for Node.js
web apps—take a look at my book [Pro
Express.js](http://proexpressjs.com).
