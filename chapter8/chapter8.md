Putting Frontend and Backend Together
=======================

In this chapter, we'll cover:

-   Adding CORS for a different-domain deployment
-   Message Board UI
-   Message Board API
-   Deployment to Heroku
-   Same-domain deployment server
-   Deployment to Amazon Web Services

Now, it's a good time to configure our front-end and back-end applications so they could work together. There are a few ways to do it:

-   Different-domain deployment: deploy two separate apps (Heroku apps) for front-end and back-end apps. Developers need to be implement CORS or JSONP to mitigate cross-domain request issues.
-   Same-domain deployment: deploy frontend and backend on the same webapp. Developers need to implement a static Node.js server to serve static assets for the front-end application. This approach is not recommended for serious production applications.

I cover both approaches in this in detail in this chapter starting with the recommended approach —different-domain deployment.

Adding CORS for Different-Domain Deployment
===========================================

This is, so far, the best practice for the production environment. Back-end applications are usually deployed at the `http://app.` or `http://api.` subdomains.

One way to make a different domain deployment work is to overcome the same-domain limitation of AJAX technology with JSONP:

```js
const request = $.ajax({
  url: url,
  dataType: 'jsonp',
  data: {...},
  jsonpCallback: 'fetchData,
  type: 'GET'
})
```

The other, and better, way to do it is to add the cross-origin resource sharing or CORS support on the server (<https://mzl.la/2LcH9lZ>). It will require to add the OPTIONS method request handler and special headers to other request handlers to the Node.js server app before the output/response. This is a special header that needs to be added to all request handlers. The `origin` is the domain but can be open to anything with `*`:

```js
    ...
    response.writeHead(200,{
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
      'Content-Length': body.length
    })
    ...
```

or `origin` value can be locked to only your front-end app location (recommended):

```js
    ...
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'your-fe-app-domain-name',
      ...
    })
    ...
```

We need a new response (route or request handler) with the OPTIONS method to tell the client (browser) what methods are supported on the server. The OPTIONS request can be implemented in the following manner:

```js
    ...
    if (request.method=="OPTIONS") {
      response.writeHead("204", "No Content", {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": origin,
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods":
          "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "content-type, accept",
        "Access-Control-Max-Age": 10, // In seconds
        "Content-Length": 0
      })
      response.end();
    }
    ...
```

Message Board UI
================

Our front-end application used Parse.com as a replacement for a back-end application. Now we can switch to our own backend by replacing the endpoints along with making a few other painless changes. Let me walk you through them.

In the beginning of the `app.js` file, uncomment the first line for running locally, or replace the URL values with your Heroku or Microsoft Azure back-end application public URLs:

```js
// const URL = 'http://localhost:1337/'
const URL ='http://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/'
```

Most of the code in `app.js` and the folder structure remained intact from the `code/05-board-backbone-parse-sdk` project (<http://bit.ly/2LfB9IQ>), with the exception of replacing Parse models and collections with original Backbone.js ones. So go ahead and type or copy the RequireJS block for loading of the dependencies (templates in this case):

```js
require([
    'libs/text!header.html',
    'libs/text!home.html',
    'libs/text!footer.html'],
    function (
        headerTpl,
        homeTpl,
        footerTpl) {
```

The `ApplicationRouter`, `HeaderView,` and `FooterView` are the same as in the `code/05-board-backbone-parse-sdk` project so I won't list them here again.

We need to change the model and collection to this from using `Parse.Object` and `Parse.Collection`. Those are the places where Backbone.js looks up for REST API URLs corresponding to the specific collection and model:

```js
    Message = Backbone.Model.extend({
        url: URL + 'messages.json'
    })
    MessageBoard = Backbone.Collection.extend ({
        model: Message,
        url: URL + 'messages.json'
    })
```

Next is the `HomeView` where most of the logic resides. I made a few enhancements to the rendering process, which is a good illustration of what you can do with events in Backbone. First, create the view and define the element selector, template (loaded via RequireJS and text plug-in), and event for the SEND button:

```js
    HomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
        el: '#content',
        template: homeTpl,
        events: {
            'click #send': 'saveMessage'
        },
```

Now, in the constructor of the view, set the `homeView` to `this` so we can use `this` later by the name inside of the callbacks/closures or use fat arrow functions `()=>{}` (otherwise, `this` can mutate inside of the callbacks/closures):

```js
initialize: function() {
    const homeView = this
```

Next, I attach an event listener `refresh` that will do the rendering. Prior to that we had the `all` event, which wasn't very good, because it triggered re-rendering multiple times on the addition of each message. The reason is that `fetch()` triggers `add()` as many times as there are messages (10, 100, 1000, etc.). So if we use the `all` event listener for `render()`, our app will unnecessarily render multiple times. A better way is to use a custom event `refresh` that we will trigger manually and only in the appropriate places (you'll see them later). This will prevent multiple re-rendering.

The following code creates the collection, creates the `refresh` event and starts the `fetch` request to populate the messages from the backend:

```js
homeView.collection = new MessageBoard()
homeView.collection.bind('refresh', homeView.render, homeView)
homeView.collection.fetch({
```

The `fetch` method will perform a GET XHR request, and it has `success` and `error` callbacks (indentation removed):

```js
success: function(collection, response, options){
    console.log('Fetched ', collection)
```

The next line will trigger rendering only after all the messages are in the collection (and came from the server response):

```js
        collection.trigger('refresh')
    },
    error: function(){
        console.error('Error fetching messages')
    }
})
```

This event listener will be triggered by the "SEND" button as well as by the `fetch`(). To avoid persisting existing records with `message.save()`, we add the check for the `message.attributes._id`. In other words, if this is an existing message and it comes from the server (`fetch`), then it will have `_id` and we stop the execution flow. Otherwise, we persist the message and trigger rendering on success:

```js
      homeView.collection.on('add', function(message) {
          if (message.attributes._id) return false
          message.save(null, {
              success: function(message) {
                  homeView.collection.trigger('refresh')
                  console.log('Saved ', message)
              },
              error: function(message) {
                  console.log('error')
              }
          })
      })
  },
```

The rest of the `HomeView` object is the same as in the `05-board-parse-sdk` project. In the `saveMessage` we get the values of the username and the message text and add the new message object to the collection with `collection.add()`. This will call the event listener `add`, which we implemented in the `initialize`.

```js
      saveMessage: function(){
          const newMessageForm = $('#new-message')
          const username = newMessageForm.find('[name="username"]').val()
          const message = newMessageForm.find('[name="message"]').val()
          this.collection.add({
              'username': username,
              'message': message
              })
      },
```

Last, we write or copy the `render` method that takes the template and the collection, then injects the resulting HTML into the element with ID content (`this.el`):

```js
      render: function() {
          console.log('Home view rendered')
          $(this.el).html(_.template(this.template)(this.collection))
      }
  })

  app = new ApplicationRouter()
  Backbone.history.start()
})
```

Here is the full source code of the `code/08-board-ui/app.js` file (<http://bit.ly/2LaHhCp>):

```js
const URL = 'http://localhost:1337/'
// const URL ='http://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/'

require([
    'libs/text!header.html',
    'libs/text!home.html',
    'libs/text!footer.html'],
    function (
        headerTpl,
        homeTpl,
        footerTpl) {

    const ApplicationRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
        routes: {
            '': 'home',
            '*actions': 'home'
        },
        initialize: function() {
            this.headerView = new HeaderView()
            this.headerView.render()
            this.footerView = new FooterView()
            this.footerView.render()
        },
        home: function() {
            this.homeView = new HomeView()
            this.homeView.render()
        }
    })

    const HeaderView = Backbone.View.extend({
        el: '#header',
        templateFileName: 'header.html',
        template: headerTpl,
        initialize: function() {
        },
        render: function() {
            $(this.el).html(_.template(this.template))
        }
    })

    const FooterView = Backbone.View.extend({
        el: '#footer',
        template: footerTpl,
        render: function() {
            this.$el.html(_.template(this.template))
        }
    })
    const Message = Backbone.Model.extend({
        url: URL + 'messages.json'
    })
    const MessageBoard = Backbone.Collection.extend ({
        model: Message,
        url: URL + 'messages.json'
    })

    const HomeView = Backbone.View.extend({
        el: '#content',
        template: homeTpl,
        events: {
            'click #send': 'saveMessage'
        },

        initialize: function() {
            this.collection = new MessageBoard()
            this.collection.bind('all', this.render, this)
            this.collection.fetch()
            this.collection.on('add', function(message) {
                message.save(null, {
                    success: function(message) {
                        console.log('saved ' + message)
                    },
                    error: function(message) {
                        console.log('error')
                    }
                })
                console.log('saved' + message)
            })
        },
        saveMessage: function(){
            const newMessageForm=$('#new-message')
            const username=newMessageForm.find('[name="username"]').val()
            const message=newMessageForm.find('[name="message"]').val()
            this.collection.add({
                'username': username,
                'message': message
                })
        },
        render: function() {
            console.log(this.collection)
            $(this.el).html(_.template(this.template, this.collection))
        }
    })

    window.app = new ApplicationRouter()
    Backbone.history.start()
})
```

This is it. For your reference, the front-end app source code is in the `code/08-board-ui` folder and on GitHub at <http://bit.ly/2LfD1Bo>. I won't list it here because we had only a few changes comparing with the Parse SDK project. The next piece of the puzzle is the backend.

Message Board API
=================

The back-end Node.js application source code is in `code/08-board-api` and at <http://bit.ly/2LbVY84>, which has this structure:

```
/08-board-api
    -web.js
    -Procfile
    -package.json
```

The `Procfile` file is for the Heroku deployment, and the `package.json` file is for project metadata as well as for Hekoru deployment.

The `web.js` file is very similar to the `08-board-api`, but has CORS headers and OPTIONS request handler code. The file starts with importation of dependencies:

```js
const http = require('http')
const util = require('util')
const querystring = require('querystring')
const client = require('mongodb').MongoClient
```

Then we set the MongoDB connection string:

```js
const uri = process.env.MONGOLAB_URI || 'mongodb://@127.0.0.1:27017/messages'
//MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://user:pass@server.mongohq.com:port/db_name
```

We connect to the database using the string and `client.connect` method. It's important to handle the error and finish the execution flow with `return` if there's an error:

```js
client.connect(uri, function(error, db) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
```

After we are sure that there were no errors (otherwise the execution flow won't come to the next line), we select the collection, which is `messages` in this case:

```js
  const collection = db.collection('messages')
```

The server code follows. We create the server instance and set up the `origin` variable based on the information from the request. This value will be in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. The idea is that the response will have the value of the client's URL:

```js
  const app = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    const origin = (request.headers.origin || '*')
```
Check the HTTP method value in `request.method`. If it's OPTIONS, which we must implement for CORS, we start writing headers to the `response` object:

```js
    if (request.method == 'OPTIONS') {
      response.writeHead('204', 'No Content', {
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
```

The next header will tell what methods are supported:

```js
        'Access-Control-Allow-Methods':
          'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'content-type, accept',
        'Access-Control-Max-Age': 10, // In seconds
        'Content-Length': 0
      })
      response.end()
```

We are done with OPTIONS, but we still need to implement GET and POST:

```js
    } else if (request.method === 'GET' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      collection.find().toArray(function(error,results) {
        if (error) return console.error(error)
        const body = JSON.stringify(results)
```

We need to add a few headers to the response of the `GET`:

```js
        response.writeHead(200,{
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
          'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
          'Content-Length': body.length
        })
        console.log('LIST OF OBJECTS: ')
        console.dir(results)
        response.end(body)
      })
```

Last but not least, we process `POST`:

```js
    } else if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      request.on('data', function(data) {
        console.log('RECEIVED DATA:')
        console.log(data.toString('utf-8'))
```

We need to parse `data` to get the object so later we can save it into the database. The next line often causes bugs because front-end apps send data in one format and the server parses another. Please make sure to use the same format on the browser and server:

```js
        collection.insert(JSON.parse(data.toString('utf-8')),
        {safe:true}, function(error, obj) {
          if (error) return console.error(error)
          console.log('OBJECT IS SAVED: ')
          console.log(JSON.stringify(obj))
          const body = JSON.stringify(obj)
```

We add the headers again. Maybe we should write a function and call it instead of writing the headers manually. Wait, Express.js is actually will do some of it for us, but that's a topic for [another book](http://proexpressjs.com) (read my book *Pro Express.js* at <http://amzn.to/1D6qiqk>). The following code supplies the CORS headers for the response:

```js
          response.writeHead(200,{
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
            'Content-Length': body.length
          })
          response.end(body)
        })
      })
    }
  })
  const port = process.env.PORT || 1337
  app.listen(port)
})
```

Here is the source code of `web.js`, our Node.js application implemented with CORS headers:

```js
const http = require('http')
const util = require('util')
const querystring = require('querystring')
const client = require('mongodb').MongoClient

const uri = process.env.MONGOLAB_URI || 'mongodb://@127.0.0.1:27017/messages'
//MONGOLAB_URI = mongodb://user:pass@server.mongohq.com:port/db_name

client.connect(uri, function(error, db) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  const collection = db.collection('messages')
  const app = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    const origin = (request.headers.origin || '*')
    if (request.method == 'OPTIONS') {
      response.writeHead('204', 'No Content', {
        'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
        'Access-Control-Allow-Methods':
          'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',
        'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'content-type, accept',
        'Access-Control-Max-Age': 10, // Seconds.
        'Content-Length': 0
      })
      response.end()
    } else if (request.method === 'GET' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      collection.find().toArray(function(error,results) {
        if (error) return console.error(error)
        const body = JSON.stringify(results)
        response.writeHead(200,{
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
          'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
          'Content-Length': body.length
        })
        console.log('LIST OF OBJECTS: ')
        console.dir(results)
        response.end(body)
      })
    } else if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      request.on('data', function(data) {
        console.log('RECEIVED DATA:')
        console.log(data.toString('utf-8'))
        collection.insert(JSON.parse(data.toString('utf-8')),
        {safe:true}, function(error, obj) {
          if (error) return console.error(error)
          console.log('OBJECT IS SAVED: ')
          console.log(JSON.stringify(obj))
          const body = JSON.stringify(obj)
          response.writeHead(200,{
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin,
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
            'Content-Length': body.length
          })
          response.end(body)
        })
      })
    }
  })
  const port = process.env.PORT || 1337
  app.listen(port)
})
```

Deployment to Heroku
====================

For your convenience, I placed the front-end app in `code/08-board-ui` and at <http://bit.ly/2LfD1Bo>. I also saved the the back-end app with CORS in the `code/08-board-api` folder, and uploaded to <http://bit.ly/2LbVY84>.

By now, you probably know what to do, but as a reference, below are the steps to deploy these examples to Heroku. We'll start with the API. In the `08-board-api` folder, execute the following code (`$ heroku login` is optional):

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -am "first commit"
    $ heroku login
    $ heroku create
    $ heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox
    $ git push heroku master

Watch the terminal messages. If the API is successfully deployed, you can test it with CURL or Postman. Then copy the URL from Heroku (e.g., https://guarded-waters-1780.herokuapp.com) and paste it into the `code/08-board-ui/app.js` file, assigning the value to the URL variable. Then, in the `code/08-board-ui` folder, execute:

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -am "first commit"
    $ heroku create
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku open

That's it. By now you should be able to see Message Board running in the cloud with the UI (front-end browser app) on one domain and the API (backend) on another. In high-trafficked apps, the API will be hiding behind a load balancer, so you can have multiple API servers on a single IP/URL. This way they'll handle more traffic and the system will become more resilient. You can take out, restart, or deploy on APIs one at a time with zero downtime.

Same-Domain Deployment Server
=============================

The same-domain deployment is *not recommended* for serious production applications, because static assets are better served with web servers like Nginx (not Node.js I/O engine), and separating APIs makes for less complicated testing, increased robustness, and quicker troubleshooting/monitoring. However, the same app/domain approach could be used for staging, testing, development environments, and/or tiny apps.

The idea is that the API serves static files for the browser app as well, not just handling dynamic requests to its routes. So you can copy the `code/08-board-api` code into a new folder `code/08-board-web` (or getting my copy from GitHub). The beginning of the new server file is the same; we have GET and POST logic (this time CORS is not needed). The last condition in the chain of `if/else` needs to process the static files. Here's how we can do a new response/request handler for static assets:

```js
const http = require('http'),
  url = require('url'),
  path = require('path'),
  fs = require('fs'),
  port = process.env.PORT || 1337,
  staticFolder = 'public',
  client = require('mongodb').MongoClient

const uri = process.env.MONGOLAB_URI || 'mongodb://@127.0.0.1:27017/messages'
//MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://user:pass@server.mongohq.com:port/db_name

client.connect(uri, function(error, db) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  const collection = db.collection('messages')

  http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    const origin = (request.headers.origin || '*')
    if (request.method == 'OPTIONS') {
      // ...
    } else if (request.method === 'GET' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      // ...
    } else if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/messages.json') {
      // ...

        switch (extname) {
            case '.js':
                contentType = 'text/javascript'
                break
            case '.css':
                contentType = 'text/css'
                break
            case '.json':
                contentType = 'application/json'
                break
            case '.png':
                contentType = 'image/png'
                break
            case '.jpg':
            case '.jpeg':
                contentType = 'image/jpg'
                break
            case '.wav':
                contentType = 'audio/wav'
                break
        }
        response.writeHead(200, {
          'Content-Type': contentType,
          'Content-Length': file.length
        })
        response.end(file)
      }
    }
  }).listen(port)

  console.log('Static file server running at\n '+
  ' => http://localhost:' + port + '/\nCTRL + C to shutdown')

})
```

Let me take you through this implementation line-by-line. We use the `url` module (<https://npmjs.org/url>) to parse the path name from the URL. The path name is everything after the domain; for example, in <http://webapplog.com/es6> the path name is `/es6`. This will be our folder and file names.

```js
      const uri = url.parse(request.url).pathname
```

It's good to have some logging to know that our system is working as it should:

```js
      console.log('Processing path: ', uri)
```

The next line deals with the root URI; that is, when you go to the website and the path is empty or a slash, you'll get `index.html`. In our app, let's follow the convention and serve the `index.html` file by default (if it exists):

```js
      if (uri == '' || uri == '/') uri = 'index.html'
```

The `path.join()` method will make this code cross-platform by creating a string with the proper slashes depending on the OS: that is, `\` or `/` as separator. You can see the resulting path and file name in the logs:

```js
      filename = path.join(__dirname, staticFolder, uri)
      console.log('Processing file: ', filename)
```

I always say never use synchronous functions in Node.js, unless you have to. This is such a case. Without the synch methods, we'll get racing conditions on our files, meaning some will load faster than the others and cause conflicts:

```js
      stats = fs.statSync(filename)
      if (error) {
        console.error(error)
```

Obviously, if the file doesn't exist we want to send 404 Not Found:

```js
        response.writeHead(404, {
          'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
        response.write('404 Not Found\n')
        return response.end()
      }
```

Let's make sure the requested resource is the file. If it's not the file, you can implement adding `index.html` as we did for the root. I don't have this code here. Our front-end app only needs to include files so this code will serve the files!

```js
      if(!stats.isFile()) {
        response.writeHead(404, {
          'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
        response.write('404 Not Found\n')
        return response.end()
      } else {
```

Finally, we read the file. We use the synchronous function again for the reasons mentioned above.

```js
        const file = fs.readFileSync(filename)
        if (!file) {
          response.writeHead(500, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})
        response.write(err + '\n')
        return response.end()
      }
```

I know that the JavaScript guru Douglas Crockford dislikes `switch`, but we'll use it here to determine the right content type for the response header. Most browsers will understand the content type okay if you omit the `Content-Type` header, but why not go the extra mile?

```js
        const extname = path.extname(filename)
        const contentType = 'text/html'
        switch (extname) {
            case '.js':
                contentType = 'text/javascript'
                break
            case '.css':
                contentType = 'text/css'
                break
            case '.json':
                contentType = 'application/json'
                break
            case '.png':
                contentType = 'image/png'
                break
            case '.jpg':
            case '.jpeg':
                contentType = 'image/jpg'
                break
            case '.wav':
                contentType = 'audio/wav'
                break
        }
        response.writeHead(200, {
          'Content-Type': contentType,
```

Another header that we send back with the response is `Content-Length`:

```js
          'Content-Length': file.length
        })
        response.end(file)
      }
    }
...
```

So this piece of code goes into the request handler of the server, which is inside of the database connect call. Just like the Russian Matreshka dolls. Confusing? Just refer to the full source code at <http://bit.ly/2LdCK20>.

Another, more elegant way is to use Node.js frameworks as Connect (<http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/static.html>), or Express (<http://expressjs.com>); because there is a special `static` middleware for JS and CSS assets. But those frameworks deserve a book on their own.

Now after you mastered basics of Node.js, MongoDB, Backbone.js, and Heroku, there's one bonus step to take. Check out the cloud solution Amazon Web Services known as EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service category of cloud computing).

Deployment to Amazon Web Services
============================================================================================================================================

Cloud is eating the world of computing. There are private and public clouds. AWS, probably the most popular choice among the public cloud offerings, falls under the IaaS category. The advantages of using an IaaS such as AWS over PaaS-like Heroku are as follows:

-   It’s more configurable (any services, packages, or operation systems).
-   It’s more controllable. There are no restrictions or limitations.
-   It’s cheaper to maintain. PaaS can quickly cost a fortune for high-performance resources.

In this tutorial, we'll be using 64-bit Amazon Linux AMI (<http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami>) with CentOS (<http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami>).

Assuming you have your EC2 instance up and running, SSH into it and install all system updates with `yum`:

    $ sudo yum update

You can try installing Node.js with `yum`. It should be available in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux repository (<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>):

    $ sudo yum install nodejs npm --enablerepo=epel

This might take a while. Answer with y as the process goes. In the end, you should see something like this (your results may vary):

```
Installed:  nodejs.i686 0:0.10.26-1.el6          npm.noarch 0:1.3.6-4.el6Dependency Installed:...Dependency Updated:...Complete!
```

You probably know this, but just in case, to check installations, type the following:

    $ node –V
    $ npm –v

If the yum Node.js installation fails, see if you have EPEL (just see if the command below says `epel`):

    $ yum repolist

If there's no `epel`, run:

    $ rpm -Uvh http://download-i2.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Then, try to install both Node.js and npm again with:

    $ sudo yum install nodejs npm --enablerepo=epel

Alternatively, you can compile Node.js from the source. To do so, install C++ compiler (again with `yum`):

    $ sudo yum install gcc-c++ make

Same with openSSL:

    $ sudo yum install openssl-devel

Then install Git with yum:

    $ sudo yum install git

Finally, clone Node.js repository straight from GitHub:

    $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git

And build Node.js:

    $ cd node
    $ git checkout v0.10.12
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Note: For a different version of Node.js, you can list them all with `$ git tag -l` and checkout the one you need.

To install npm, run:

    $ git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
    $ cd npm
    $ sudo make install

More information on using yum can be found at the following locations:

-   [Managing Software with yum](https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/yum) (<https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/yum>)
-   [Installing Node.js via package managers](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) (<https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager>)
-   [Tips on securing your EC2 instance](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233) (<http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233>)

Once you have Git and npm and Node, you are good to deploy your code (manually). Pull the code from the repository. You might need to provide credentials or upload your SSH keys to the AWS. Then start the Node server with [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) (<https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>) or similar process manager (Figure 8-1). `pm2` is good because it has a lot of features not only to keep the process running but also to scale it; it even has load balancing.

To install pm2:

    $ npm i -g pm2

To start your application:

    $ pm2 start app.js

To list all running processes:

    $ pm2 list

![](media/image1.png)

***Figure 8-1*** *pm2 running multiple Node.js processes.*

That's pretty much all you need to do. Ideally you want to automate the deployment. Also, you might want to add some `d.init` or `upstart` scripts to launch your `pm2` or another process manager automatically.

Steps for other OS on AWS are similar. You would use their package manager to install Node, Git, and npm, then get the code (Git or rsync) and launch it with the process manager. You don't need the process manager. You can launch with `node` itself, but it's better to use some process manager.

Now, while the Node.js app is running, executing `$ netstat -apn | grep 80`, the remote machine should show the process. For example, for a Node.js app listening on port 80:

```
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80                  0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1064/node
```

On the EC2 instance, either configure the firewall to redirect connections (e.g., port to Node.js 3000, but this is too advanced for our example) or disable the firewall (okay for our quick demonstration and development purposes):

    $ service iptables save$ service iptables stop$ chkconfig iptables off

In the AWS console, find your EC2 instance and apply a proper rule to allow for inbound traffic, for example,

    Protocol: TCPPort Range: 80Source: 0.0.0.0/0

And from your local machine, that is, your development computer, you can either use the public IP or the public DNS (the Domain Name System) domain, which is found and copied from the AWS console under that instance’s description. For example,

    $ curl XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX –v

It’s worth mentioning that AWS supports many other operating systems via its AWS Marketplace (<https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace>). Although AWS EC2 is a very popular and affordable choice, there other alternatives as well: [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com) (<https://www.joyent.com>), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us), [Rackspace Open Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud) (<http://www.rackspace.com/cloud>), and others.

Summary
=======

This chapter deals with descriptions of different deployment approaches, the final version of Message Board application, and its deployment with two approaches: different and the same domains. We covered deployment using the Git and Heroku command-line interfaces to deploy to PaaS. And we worked through examples of installing and building a Node.js environment on AWS EC2 and running Node.js apps on AWS with CentOS.
